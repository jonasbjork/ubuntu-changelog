Usage:

This script will create a changelog from two files:
before.csv and after.csv which has been created from the 
following command:
	dpkg -l | grep ^ii | awk '{print $2 "," $3}' > before.csv

Before you are upgrading the Ubuntu operating system you create 
the `before.csv` file:

	dpkg -l | grep ^ii | awk '{print $2 "," $3}' > before.csv

Then you upgrade the operating system with the normal `apt-get` 
commands, and then you create the `after.csv` file:

	dpkg -l | grep ^ii | awk '{print $2 "," $3}' > after.csv

With both csv files in the same folder as `changelog.rb` you run 
the script:

	ruby changelog.rb 

Output is difference between packages installed before, and after, 
the upgrade.
